# Here is my first Java Spring Boot Web App!


## About
The project was made with Spring Boot. In this project, I have used following technologies/languages: 
- Java 
- Javascript (jQuery)
- CSS (Bootstrap 5) 
- HTML 
- JSP 
- Spring Boot 
- Maven 
- Hibarnate
- etc.

## Usage
The purpose of the application is to allow the user to save invoices and customers in to the database.
User is apply to generate a PDF invoice from the entered/saved data.

The application does not process any transactions. User can mark the status of the invoice either as a draft, sent or paid. An unregistered user can visit the “landing”, “login” and “register” pages of the application. Other sites need to be logged in.

I think the app has many small features that may not be immediately noticeable, but greatly improve usability. When creating the app, I really took into account the usability of the app and kept testing it along whole process.
